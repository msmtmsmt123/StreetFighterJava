Things to do

Important:
1) Change the frame when Dhalsim deals damage to be in sync with animation
	- Most noticeable with HPunch
2) Fix errors in both players jumping at once 
	- If Player 1 jumps when Player 2 is holding down the jump button, it will negate Player 2's jump.
3) End game when time runs out
4) Fix block (according to distance between hitbox and atkbox)
5) Improve HUD
	- Add char names
	- Make time look better


Others:
 - add combos
 - add super/ultra moves (and the bar)
 - Increase block animation time (optional, if have time)
 - Insert all characters
 - add powerups
 	- potions
 	- Invincibility (remove hitbox for a few seconds)
 	- Speed boost
 - add highscores (read and write to file)
